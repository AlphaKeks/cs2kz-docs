# Differences from GOKZ

As CS2 has replaced CS:GO, CS2KZ is now supposed to (more or less) replace
[GOKZ](https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/gokz).

While CS:GO, and therefore GOKZ, is still playable, actually playing requires
work-arounds and it is unclear for how long this house of cards will hold up
going into the future. The people working on CS2KZ have spent a considerable
amount of time in the CS:GO KZ community both as players and developers, and as
such we are taking previous experiences into account when it comes to working
on CS2KZ. What it does **not** mean is that we intend to replicate GOKZ 1:1 in
CS2. A lot of things are *different*, and whether you like that is up to you.

Below you can find a list of important differences that you might want to know
about if you are a CS:GO KZ player discovering CS2KZ:
