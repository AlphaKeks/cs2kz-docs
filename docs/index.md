# Welcome to CS2KZ
CS2KZ is a skill-based mod for Counter-Strike 2 where players complete
challenging obstacle courses that test their precision, speed, and movement
skills. Compete against yourself or others, improve your abilities, and climb
the ranks as you master each course.

## 2 Modes

CS2KZ features two different game modes:
[Vanilla](/modes#vanilla) and [Classic](/modes#classic)

[Vanilla](/modes#vanilla) resembles the default movement experience you would
also get in regular matchmaking, while [Classic](/modes#classic) is closer to
what most people would expect when they think of KZ.

## Styles

Different [styles](/styles) allow you to customize gameplay independent of
modes.

## The Global Map Pool

An [official list of maps](https://cs2kz.org/maps) for you to play and
contribute to!

See [the guidelines](/mapping/approval) for how to submit your own maps.

## Global Servers

An [offical list of servers](https://cs2kz.org/servers) for you to play on!

See [the guidelines](/servers/approval) for how to get your own server.

## Player Ratings

Competing will award you [points](ranking#points) on each leaderboard and
contributes to your overall [player rating](ranking#rating).
