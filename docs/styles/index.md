# Styles

"styles" are modifications to gameplay that are applied on top of your
[mode](/modes). They are also additive, which means you can apply as many as
you want at the same time. Runs with styles do not award
[points](/ranking#points) or contribute to your
[player rating](/ranking#rating). Currently CS2KZ only features a single style,
but just like with modes, you can make your own!

Below you can find a detailed list of all official styles.

## AutoBhop

The "AutoBhop" (or "ABH") style will allow you to hold your `+jump` key (the
space key by default) and get perfect bunny hops 100% of the time.
