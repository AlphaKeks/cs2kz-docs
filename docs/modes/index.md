# CS2KZ Modes

CS2KZ features two *official* modes (you can make your own!). You can switch
your mode using the `!vnl` and `!ckz` commands.

## Vanilla

The "Vanilla" (or "VNL") mode is supposed to resemble the default CS2 gameplay,
as you would experience it in matchmaking. This means you can play VNL to
practice your movement on the side, even if you're not mainly a KZ player. Any
oddities or inconsistencies with this mode that are also found in the regular
game will **not** be "fixed" or removed; the intention is to be as close as
possible to the real™️ CS2 experience.

## Classic

The "Classic" (or "CKZ") mode is supposed to have heavily modified gameplay,
which means higher air acceleration, consistent bunny hopping, pre-strafing,
and more. If you've played a previous iteration of KZ, this is probably the
mode you want to play!
