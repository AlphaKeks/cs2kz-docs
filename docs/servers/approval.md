# Server Approval

You can create new servers on [the dashboard](https://dashboard.cs2kz.org).
Each user has a "server budget", or in other words: an amount of servers they
can create.

Everyone starts out with a budget of 0, and the budget is managed
manually. This may change in the future, but for now, you have to explicitly
ask either on [the forum](https://forum.cs2kz.org) or
[our Discord server](https://discord.gg/csgokz) if you want your own CS2KZ
server.

Once you have created a server, it will be assigned its own API Key. This key
can be placed into your server's configuration file to active the connection to
the GlobalAPI.

## Rules

If you are a server owner, there are certain rules you will have to follow. If
you fail to do so, servers may be taken away from you, and we will be more
critical when it comes to increasing your server budget.

- Your server must run
  [an official release](https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/cs2kz-metamod/releases)
  of [`cs2kz-metamod`](https://github.com/KZGlobalTeam/cs2kz-metamod).
- Your server must **not** run *any other* plugins that modify movement in
  *any* way.
- You must **not** use your server's API Key for anything but that server. This
  includes but is not limited to:
   - using the key for multiple servers
   - using the key for authenticating with the API manually
   - sharing the key with someone else
- Your server must have consistent uptime. If your server is offline too much,
  its API Key will be taken away.
- Your server must be accessible to the administration of CS2KZ at all times,
  should manual inspection be necessary.
- Your server's name or branding must **not** include any discriminating,
  obscene, or sexually explicit terms.
